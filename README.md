## What is a Sierpiński triangle?

The [Sierpiński triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle) is a [fractal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal)
that consists of a set of points in the plane and a set of line segments
in the plane.

[Wacław Franciszek Sierpiński](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wac%C5%82aw_Sierpi%C5%84ski) was a Polish mathematician.

The Sierpiński triangle is a fractal with the following properties:

* Every vertex of the triangle is a point in the plane.
* Every edge of the triangle is a line segment in the plane.
* Every triangle is a subgroup of the plane.
* The number of triangles in the plane is a power of 3.

## How to run the program

To run the program, type the following in a terminal window:

    'python sierpinski.py'
    
or    

    'python3 sierpinski.py'

## What does the program do?

The program draws a Sierpiński triangle using the Turtle library and a recursive function.
